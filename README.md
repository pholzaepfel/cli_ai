Scripts for accessing the OpenAI API from the terminal.

Anything here is really intended for my own personal use, and contains a bare limit of best practice.
I recommend aliasing the script here:

```
alias ai="~/ai.sh"
```

The script can then be invoked as:

```
$ai "Your prompt here."
```

There are a lot of cases it doesn't handle. I don't care. This is to provide quick one-off answers
which are my most common use case.

WHY?

I'm starting to see a lot of tools out there that promise interfacing with ChatGPT's APIs, yet
this API is one of the simplest, most straightforward I've ever used. POST goes in data comes out.

Also, I live in and love the terminal, and this is just faster and less fricition for me.

Enjoy at your own risk. :)
