Scripts for accessing the OpenAI API from the terminal.

Anything here is really intended for my own personal use, and contains a bare limit of best practice.
I recommend aliasing the script here:

```
alias ai="~/ai.sh"
```

The script can then be invoked as:

```
$ai "Your prompt here."
```

There are a lot of cases it doesn't handle. I don't care. This is to provide quick one-off answers
which are my most common use case.
